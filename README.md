### An Internet-of-Things smart mirror built with JavaScript and Raspberry Pi - works with a [client-side dashboard](https://github.com/alfred-mirror/alfred-dashboard) which pushes directly to the [mirror display](https://github.com/alfred-mirror/alfred-display).

#### The App is on [Heroku](http://alfred-dashboard.herokuapp.com/)
It is recommended to use the deployed version of this app so you don't have to constantly run a local server. However, an installation guide for a local server is included below.

#### Installation to Run Locally

Git clone this repo and install all dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/alfred-mirror/alfred-display.git
cd alfred-display
npm install
```

This Alfred server saves the user's config settings into a [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) database which you also need to start up locally (make sure you have [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed on your device).
```
mkdir db
mongod --dbpath=./db --smallfiles
```

Then start the server. Make sure both the client dashboard and the mirror display's servers are also running. The entire app should be now working on the client dashboard's specified port or defaults to ```localhost:3000```.
```
node server.js
```
